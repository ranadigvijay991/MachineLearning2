OpenNMT is an open source ecosystem for neural machine translation and neural sequence learning.
OpenNMT provides implementations in 2 popular deep learning frameworks:
Each implementation has its own set of unique features but shares similar goals:

Highly configurable model architectures and training procedures
Efficient model serving capabilities for use in real world applications
Extensions to allow other tasks such as text generation, tagging, summarization, image to text, and speech to text
